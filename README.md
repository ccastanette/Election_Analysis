# Election_Analysis

## Project Overview

The goal of this analysis was to use python to calculate the election results from a local congressional election.

We were to provide the following:
  1. The total votes cast in the election
  2. The candidates names, the percentage of votes they received as well as the total count of votes they received.
  3. Calculate the winner of the election and display their total winning vote count and winning percentage
  4. Export the information above to a text file that can be provided to our managers
